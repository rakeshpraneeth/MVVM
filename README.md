# MVVM

The main theme of the project is to give an idea about MVP design pattern works.

We use the Android data Binding concept in this project.

<b>Prerequisites<b> : Data Binding concepts

<b>View</b> : Informs the ViewModel about the user’s actions

<b>ViewModel</b> : Exposes streams of data relevant to the View

<b>Model</b> : Abstracts the data source. The ViewModel works with the DataModel to get and save the data.
